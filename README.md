## Project Overview

This project mirrors a real Business Analytics engagement at a U.S. bank. A credit card operations division had no real-time visibility into its application processing performance — SLA breaches were discovered after the fact, exception queues were unmanaged, and there was no data-driven basis for improving automation efficiency.

The project delivers a complete solution: from Business Requirements Document through data generation, cleaning, EDA, Power BI dashboard build, UAT testing, key findings and actionable recommendations.

## The Business Problem

A U.S. bank processing credit card applications had:

- No real-time dashboard showing STP rate, manual review rate or SLA compliance
- SLA breaches discovered after they occur — no proactive alerting system
- Exception queue managed on FIFO basis with no aging or priority visibility
- No data on which exception types drive the most manual reviews
